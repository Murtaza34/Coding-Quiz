# Multiple Choice Coding Quiz
### About the project
In this project I've created a multiple choice coding quiz with a timer that records high scores and quiz-takers' initials.

Using web APIs as a testing ground for my learnings was the main goal of this project. I've discovered how powerful and versatile they can be in web development. 

#### DOM Traversal and Manipulation

understanding DOM Traversal and Manipulation was beneficial, I learned how to use JavaScript to select elements, traverse through the different parts of the DOM, and make changes to the content, styles, and layout of a web page. I found this skill to be extremely useful, as it allowed me to create dynamic and interactive web pages.

### What does the application do?

- When the user clicks the start button,
- a timer starts and the user is presented with a question .
- The user answers the questions and for each incorrect answer, time is subtracted from the clock.
- Once all questions have been answered or the timer reaches 0, the game will be over.
- After the game is over, the user will be able to save their score and initials.
